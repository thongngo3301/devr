<h1>Devr Assignment Documentation</h1>

My assignment documentation will include these below parts:
  1. [Setup environment with Ansible](setup/README.md): I will use Bash script and Ansible to one-click set everything up, including Jenkins, Docker and some OS configuration.
  2. [Jenkins job DSL](job-dsl/README.md): I will use a Jenkins plugin called Job DSL in order to create Jenkins pipelines from code, which will provide us a better way to create and manage them.
